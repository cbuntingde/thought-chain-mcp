# MCP Thinking Instructions

## Core Principles

### Thinking Process
- Always use the thinking MCP server before writing new files or editing existing files
- Always think deep to understand the task before implementing them

## Implementation Guidelines

### Pre-Implementation Requirements
1. **Deep Analysis**: Thoroughly understand the task requirements and existing codebase
2. **Integration Planning**: Identify where new code should be integrated within existing files
3. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure all code meets enterprise-grade standards

## Development Workflow

### Analysis Phase
- Use thinking MCP server for deep task understanding
- Review existing codebase structure and patterns
- Identify integration points

### Implementation Phase
- Integrate new functionality into existing files
- Follow established coding standards
- Ensure enterprise-grade quality

### Validation Phase
- Test implementation thoroughly
- Verify production readiness
- Ensure proper integration with existing systems
